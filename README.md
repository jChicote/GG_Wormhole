<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Wormhole Simulation for Games and Graphics Project 2020.

#### 1. Introductions

Wormhole is a Unity-based modelling of theoretical wormholes developed for the UTS Games and Graphics project. 
The simulation has achieves visual objectives in relation to the effect of the wormhole's distortion and projection 
in interactive game setting. This Unity project includes the URP shader graph that contains a visual node-based representation 
of the modelled wormhole and the main C# code used to drive that rendering.

#### 2. Project Purpose

This project is intended as a proof-of-concept utilising existing technologies and tools within game engines. 
It pursues the need to develop a game or graphical solution towards research problems. Thus wormholes, were pursued 
due to very limited exposure within game development and in games (as of 2020) but also one which excludes strong use 
of theoretical models in driving the nature of light traversing through a wormhole. Instead, modelling its properties 
with different methods that offers a close proximity to real theoretical examples and possibly offer alternatives that 
leverages on less-intensive graphics.

This project has been completed as of late 2020 and is now available on [Itch.io](https://jaidenchicote.itch.io/games-graphics-wormholes).

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the project for your desktop:

```
* Unity HUB
* Unity 2019.4.8f
```

### Installation

1. Before cloning project, ensure to have Unity HUB installed for ease of managing project versions. Within the 'install' tab of the Unity HUB window,
download the Unity version mentioned above (in Prerequisites). Refer to the Unity Archive to search for previous versions: [Unity Archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
2. Clone the project then select the add button within Unity HUB to browse the path to your cloned repository. This will add the project to list of Unity projects.
3. Ensure to change the Unity Version through the dropdown, and select the version mentioned above.
4. Now it's ready and open the project :).

Note: Project can run on comprable systems as long as it contains usable integrated graphics or dedicated graphics from the last 10 years.
